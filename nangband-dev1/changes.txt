Nangband ChangeLog - If it's not broken, let's fix it until it is.
==================

2002-08-09
----------
- Added a new object_bonus structure.  This is currently only used
  by ego-items, but will eventually be used for randarts and branding
  of items.   A call to object_make_bonuses(object_type*) will ensure
  that o_ptr->bonuses is created.  Then, use o_ptr->bonuses->* (eg-
  flags[1-3], cost, resists[], stats[]) to change values; the appropriate
  object_blah_aux functions have been updated to use add these values in.
  Then, at object cleanup, it is deallocated if it exists.  However,
  there seems to be a problem with the savefile loading code (:/); I need
  a rest and can't fix it now.  (been coding for 8 hours). Savefiles are
  incompatible with previous versions now this change has been made.
  (takkaria)
- Changed all F:STAT lines in ego_item.txt to S:x:x:x:x:x:x format lines.
  (takkaria)
- Cleaned up the code relating to the "R:" lines and added one for ego-items;
  this takes the form of "R:STATNAME:min:max".  Appropriate documentation
  will be added to ego_item.txt soon. (takkaria)
- Randarts use the "suffix_name" field of object_bonus instead of it's own;
  object_desc has been updated appropriately. (takkaria)

2002-08-08
----------
- Added a new "R" line to object.txt; this defines resists and should be used
  in preference to RES_blah<n>.  All the definitions in object.txt have been
  changed, and I will add the code for the rest tomorrow. (takkaria)
- Created a timeplan.  Should be in the CVS tomorrow, when I'm not using a
  remote session to do all my code. (takkaria)

from 2002-08-04 to 2002-08-07
-----------------------------
- Some clever debugging code added; this was originally in running.c (as it
  was being used for debugging the running code), but it now is in it's own
  file.  Most makefiles have been updated (some have been made more readable,
  as a side-job).  It uses a hook output system, similar to text_out().
  (takkaria)
- Removed Makefile.bsd; those who use Berkely make can grab the gmake sources
  themselves and compile it!  At a future time, I may reintroduce this file.
  (takkaria)
- Fixed up the running code (to some extent).  It should be fairly useable now,
  even though there are slight problems (for some reason, running to the right
  seems to fail constantly).  It's fast reaching the useability of the old
  code; soon, it should take notice of the various running options the player
  can set.  Also, the running code is scattered with debug_out()s.  If you
  want to remove the output of these, change the
  "debug_out_hook = debug_out_to_stderr;" line to "debug_out_hook = NULL".
  (takkaria)

2002-08-04
----------
- Forgot to call note_spot in the monster light update code (in one place),
  causing ABSORB_LIGHT to interact strangely with maps. (pelpel)

2002-08-02
----------
- Added the USE_CHOICE_PATH option; with this defined, PRIVATE_USER_PATH
  will be ~/Choices/Angband/Nangband instead of ~/.angband/Nangband.
  An option in the makefile has been added (normally set off).
  (takkaria)

2002-07-31
----------
- Reorganized the lua files.  Also, updated the Vanilla's spell code -
  it looks much nicer.  Added the basics of class/race powers.
  Moved debugging stuff into lib/script/debug/.  (takkaria)
- Made the powers interface a bit more flexible.  (takkaria)
- Fixed the savefile loading bug.  (takkaria)

2002-07-29
----------
- Added support for ABSORB_LIGHT, using linked lists to avoid the calls for
  ang_sort. They uses about 12K of additional memory... (pelpel)
- Changed all occurences of 'lite' to 'light' in object.lua. (pelpel)
- Altered the standard makefile to allow other compilers to be
  intergrated into it more easily. (takkaria)
- Got all (non-lua) code compiling with TCC 0.9.8 - 0.9.9 segfaults on
  randart.c, but 0.9.8 has parsing problems with the lua header files.
  Hopefully 1.0.0 will compile Angband completely cleanly. (takkaria)
- Made the running code take notice of terrain flags.  This should
  prevent some problems. (takkaria)
- Removed the silly compiler warnings from the borg sources. (takkaria)
- Added '-x' as a command-line option; it printf()s savefile loading
  messages for assisting debugging. (takkaria)
- Setting reload_dungeon to TRUE in save.c will prompt the user about
  regenerating the dungeon that they're on at the end of the loading
  process. (takkaria)
- Added "meta-versions" to the object and monster parsing functions.
  If the monster meta-version isn't equal to the one found in the
  savefile, it sets reload_dungeon. (see above)
  Also, object.txt and monster.txt now have the "M" field for specifying
  this. (takkaria)

2002-07-28
----------
- generate_cave() didn't clear the cave_info2 array, causing various weird
  effects. (pelpel)
- Broken doors don't count for the purpose of easy open/close, because the
  game offers ways to tell them from open doors, and I feel it's mildly
  annoying to be asked to choose them only to get the responce telling me
  I can't do so. (pelpel)

2002-07-27
----------
- Added the monster light code, mixing the Z and Tome one (which is based
  on the former), with necessary modifications to make it work with the GRID
  macros. Please note that "if (view_monster_light)" is commented out in
  xtra1.c because it isn't defined yet. (pelpel)

2002-07-23
----------
- Tweaked some stuff at start.  Astral characters don't start with torches
  any more, but instead start with ((random number from 15 to 17) * 5)
  identify scrolls.  They also have slight bonuses to their weapons. (takkaria) 

2002-07-22
----------
- New option: "pseudo_light". Pseudo-ID type is no longer based on class.
  Instead, if this option is off, your character will have 'heavy'
  pseudo-ID and will therefore sense {average}, {special}, etc.... If
  on, you will only sense lightly, but will have a score advantage.
  (takkaria; idea taken from Gumband)
- Changed the total_score() code so it now gives much more "specific"
  scores; inventory+equipment cost is counted, and options give score modifiers.
  (takkaria)

2002-07-18
----------
- Divorced the new CAVE_TDETECT flag from cave_info[][]; it is now in 
  cave_info2[][].  This is for efficiency.  The savefile code doesn't handle
  old dungeons; it now prompts for dungeon regeneration.  (takkaria)
- Added basic terrain flags; I still need to add some to lib/edit/terrain.txt.
  (takkaria)

2002-07-09
----------
- Fixed two bugs; enchant_spell() was called incorrectly from the Lua scripts,
  and the logic for bounds checking in cmd1.c was reversed. (takkaria)

2002-07-01
----------
- Renamed the disturb_panel option to disturb_detect. It disturbs the player
  when s/he is about to leave trap detected area. (pelpel)
- Added the trap detection status indicator. (pelpel)
- Slightly shortened the speed field and moved the depth field to fit the trap
  detection field in. All the available columns are used now. Please note that
  the last column on the last line cannot be used safely on character display
  terminals. (pelpel)

2002-06-30
----------
- Fixed a bug that allowed astral players to use word of recall to
  reach the surface. (parody)

2002-06-29
----------
- Fiddled around with the cygwin and "standard" makefiles - they are
  (should be) much smaller in file size. (takkaria)
- Fixed a compiler warning in util.c. (takkaria)
- Made cave_info a u16b array (from a byte array) for pelpel to do
  some UI stuff - also changed savefile code appropriately. (takkaria)
- Fix for the Half-Troll & Elf races; they were broken.  Many thanks
  to Mogami! (takkaria)
- Added astral mode.  This allows the player to start at the bottom
  of the dungeon and work upwards.  Try playing with evil mode on! ;)
  (takkaria)

2002-06-26
----------
- Added "evil mode" to Nangband - tread lightly! :) (takkaria)
- Fixed some index errors with the options tables. (takkaria)

2002-06-16
----------
- Fixed a compiler warning and added various files to ".cvsignore"s.
  (takkaria)

2002-06-12
----------
- Merged the experimental branch into the trunk. (takkaria)
- Cleaned out hundreds of warnings all over the source. (takkaria)

2002-06-04
----------
(experimental branch)
- New running code is working. (takkaria)

(normal branch)
- Changed some file headers.  Nangband is now completely GPL'd.
  (takkaria)

2002-06-02
----------
- Updated to the latest [v] CVS; this brings some niceties.
  (takkaria)
- [v] also brought a nasty; in character dumps, objects' abilities
  were shown on-screen rather than in the file - fixed. (takkaria)
- Fixed a typo in thanks.txt. (takkaria)
- Got autoconf & friends working again. (takkaria)
- Added weak hits, from Parodyingband. (parody)

2002-05-26
----------
- New RISC OS resources files for lua; fixed using some quick hacks.
  (ajps)
- A new set of RISC OS resources, with many changes and now looking
  much more like Angband source code. (takkaria)

2002-05-24
----------
- New randart code is in!  Savefile compatibility is lost, sadly.
  (takkaria)

2002-05-18
----------
- Moved divisions after multiplications in resist_player_current in
  two places, so that precisions aren't lost. (pelpel)

2002-05-12
----------
- Made timed resists decrement over time; quite cool code, don't know
  how to explain it clearly, really. (takkaria)
- Made the "display version" command show the splash screen. (takkaria)
- Fixed array indices into k_info in object.lua -- C's k_info[0] corresponds
  to k_info[1] in Lua. (pelpel)
- Big screen support for GCU. As nangband -? says, it can be activated
  by nangband -- -b. Curses implementations react differently to SIGWINCH
  and I have no idea how to implement portable resizing... (pelpel)
- Imported lua bit operator implementation from Vanilla 3.0.0 CVS,
  which compiles on lcc, doesn't offend some cpp's with empty arguments
  and is more readable. (pelpel)
- Moved up the "Remaining gold:" display by one line, so that it doesn't
  interact strangely with the shop action prompt. (pelpel)
- Imported a couple of my lua engine fixes cleaned up by rr9 --
  this is only relevant for users of CodeWarrior. (pelpel)
- Removed size_y hack in store.c and rewrote the entire file to use the
  real display height throughout, partly for the sake of clarity and
  partly because it was responsible for some display problems. (pelpel)

2002-05-02
----------
- Fixed bug with monster blows, as suggested by pelpel. (parody)

2002-04-30
----------
- Fixed up lots of the save code, thanks pelpel. (takkaria)
- Added pelpel's equippy chars patch; they are now an option. (takkaria)
- Applied pelpel's main-xaw.c patch. (takkaria)
- Changed referances to 'lite', to 'light'. (parody)
- Added some belts. (parody)

2002-04-29
----------
- Made p_ptr->history a single [250], instead of [4][60]. (takkaria)

2002-04-28
----------
- Many fixes from pelpel.  Character now load, even if they are very
  messed up. (takkaria)
- Twiddled with object recall.  Not quite perfect in relation to the
  new stat code. (takkaria)
- Added a basic monster kill count. (parody)

2002-04-27
----------
- Efficientised the o_ptr->note code.  It now reads/writes a byte for
  whether there is a "note" record.  If there is, it reads/writes it.
  Combined the code for saving/loading here properly too. (takkaria)
- Fixed some silly, silly bugs, such as not reading in blocks. (!!!)
  (ajps)

Between 2002-04-21 and 2002-04-27
---------------------------------
- Merged the saving and loading code.  Broken.
- Still broken after a few days debugging.
- Made some code much more efficient.
- Moved the stat bonuses from the pval to their own arrayed variable.

2002-04-21
----------
- Finished off the new savefile saving code; fixed many bugs, segmentation
  faults.  Thanks to Antimatter, sfuerst, Kieron, Qlzqqlzup, Varitek on
  #angband. (takkaria)
- New makefile.std --> cygwin is incroporated into it now.

2002-04-06
----------
- Instead of being capped at 1600, many monster breaths are now capped
  at their dungeon level * 10. Suggested by JLE and Nathan Mahon.
  (takkaria)

2002-04-01
----------
- Finished off the object recall && started adding the character dump
  version. (takkaria)
- Written a (hopefully) better screen output hook. (ajps)
- Written a new block output function. (ajps)
- Changed some unction names. (takkaria)

2002-03-31
----------
- Made the object recall code usable; there's still a little more to do
  on it. (takkaria)
- Added the view_player_colour option from Zangband CVS; this changes the 
  colour of your '@' depending on how much HP you have left. (takkaria)
- Removed the unused 'alert_failure' option. (takkaria)

----------
- Improved the layout of the birthscreen. Implemented the first
  (excessive) use of 'Window Popups'.

2002-03-20
----------
- The RISC OS port is now completely broken. The lua scripts take a part
  in this. I'm trying to fix it.

2002-03-16
----------
- Remember to add Livingstones, Phase Reavers and the joke monster
  'The Iron Lady'. (takkaria)
- Added in Antiband's new roller code, along with changes to init1.c
  so defaults can be non-hardcoded. (takkaria)
- Added Antiband's new vaults. (takkaria)


2002-03-15
----------
- Rewrote small chunks of the store code for better displaying. (takkaria)
- Added bigscreen support for the stores. (takkaria)
- Tidied code in store.c. (takkaria)
