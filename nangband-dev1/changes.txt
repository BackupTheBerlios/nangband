Nangband ChangeLog - If it's not broken, let's fix it until it is.
==================

2002-06-29
----------
- Fiddled around with the cygwin and "standard" makefiles - they are
  (should be) much smaller in file size. (takkaria)
- Fixed a compiler warning in util.c. (takkaria)
- Made cave_info a u16b array (from a byte array) for pelpel to do
  some UI stuff - also changed savefile code appropriately. (takkaria)
- Fix for the Half-Troll & Elf races; they were broken.  Many thanks
  to Mogami! (takkaria)

2002-06-26
----------
- Added "evil mode" to Nangband - tread lightly! :) (takkaria)
- Fixed some index errors with the options tables. (takkaria)

2002-06-16
----------
- Fixed a compiler warning and added various files to ".cvsignore"s.
  (takkaria)

2002-06-12
----------
- Merged the experimental branch into the trunk. (takkaria)
- Cleaned out hundreds of warnings all over the source. (takkaria)

2002-06-04
----------
(experimental branch)
- New running code is working. (takkaria)

(normal branch)
- Changed some file headers.  Nangband is now completely GPL'd.
  (takkaria)

2002-06-02
----------
- Updated to the latest [v] CVS; this brings some niceties.
  (takkaria)
- [v] also brought a nasty; in character dumps, objects' abilities
  were shown on-screen rather than in the file - fixed. (takkaria)
- Fixed a typo in thanks.txt. (takkaria)
- Got autoconf & friends working again. (takkaria)
- Added weak hits, from Parodyingband. (parody)

2002-05-26
----------
- New RISC OS resources files for lua; fixed using some quick hacks.
  (ajps)
- A new set of RISC OS resources, with many changes and now looking
  much more like Angband source code. (takkaria)

2002-05-24
----------
- New randart code is in!  Savefile compatibility is lost, sadly.
  (takkaria)

2002-05-18
----------
- Moved divisions after multiplications in resist_player_current in
  two places, so that precisions aren't lost. (pelpel)

2002-05-12
----------
- Made timed resists decrement over time; quite cool code, don't know
  how to explain it clearly, really. (takkaria)
- Made the "display version" command show the splash screen. (takkaria)
- Fixed array indices into k_info in object.lua -- C's k_info[0] corresponds
  to k_info[1] in Lua. (pelpel)
- Big screen support for GCU. As nangband -? says, it can be activated
  by nangband -- -b. Curses implementations react differently to SIGWINCH
  and I have no idea how to implement portable resizing... (pelpel)
- Imported lua bit operator implementation from Vanilla 3.0.0 CVS,
  which compiles on lcc, doesn't offend some cpp's with empty arguments
  and is more readable. (pelpel)
- Moved up the "Remaining gold:" display by one line, so that it doesn't
  interact strangely with the shop action prompt. (pelpel)
- Imported a couple of my lua engine fixes cleaned up by rr9 --
  this is only relevant for users of CodeWarrior. (pelpel)
- Removed size_y hack in store.c and rewrote the entire file to use the
  real display height throughout, partly for the sake of clarity and
  partly because it was responsible for some display problems. (pelpel)

2002-05-02
----------
- Fixed bug with monster blows, as suggested by pelpel. (parody)

2002-04-30
----------
- Fixed up lots of the save code, thanks pelpel. (takkaria)
- Added pelpel's equippy chars patch; they are now an option. (takkaria)
- Applied pelpel's main-xaw.c patch. (takkaria)
- Changed referances to 'lite', to 'light'. (parody)
- Added some belts. (parody)

2002-04-29
----------
- Made p_ptr->history a single [250], instead of [4][60]. (takkaria)

2002-04-28
----------
- Many fixes from pelpel.  Character now load, even if they are very
  messed up. (takkaria)
- Twiddled with object recall.  Not quite perfect in relation to the
  new stat code. (takkaria)
- Added a basic monster kill count. (parody)

2002-04-27
----------
- Efficientised the o_ptr->note code.  It now reads/writes a byte for
  whether there is a "note" record.  If there is, it reads/writes it.
  Combined the code for saving/loading here properly too. (takkaria)
- Fixed some silly, silly bugs, such as not reading in blocks. (!!!)
  (ajps)

Between 2002-04-21 and 2002-04-27
---------------------------------

- Moved the stat bonuses from the pval to their own arrayed variable.

2002-04-21
----------
- Finished off the new savefile saving code; fixed many bugs, segmentation
  faults.  Thanks to Antimatter, sfuerst, Kieron, Qlzqqlzup, Varitek on
  #angband. (takkaria)

2002-04-06
----------
- Instead of being capped at 1600, many monster breaths are now capped
  at their dungeon level * 10. Suggested by JLE and Nathan Mahon.
  (takkaria)

----------
- Finished off the object recall && started adding the character dump
  version. (takkaria)

2002-03-31
----------
- Made the object recall code usable; there's still a little more to do

  'The Iron Lady'. (takkaria)
