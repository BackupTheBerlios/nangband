<h2 align="centre">Compiling Angband</h2>
<p>You probably won't need to compile Angband if you use Windows or DOS, as
these ports are normally available precompiled.  However, if you want to
compile your own personalized version (or if the port for your particular
platform doesn't exist), then read on.</p>

<h3>DOS + DJGPP</h3>
<p>Written by Robert Ruehlmann (rr9@angband.org)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Install DJGPP:
		<p>You can get the freely available DJGPP C Compiler from (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/).
		   On the DJGPP-page go to the Zip-Picker (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/zip-picker.html).
		   This page helps you decide which ZIP files you need to download and will even try to
		   find an FTP site near you. If you want to have graphics and sound then you also need the
		   Allegro library (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/). Get all files and follow the
		   installation instructions.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install the Angband source:
		<p>Get the source code archive and the untgz tool from ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Tool/untgz.exe.
		   Then extract the source with untgz.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install other required files:
		<p>Get the &quot;extra archive&quot; from (ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/DOS-386/ext-dos-300.zip).
		   Go to the angband directory and unzip the ext-dos archive into it.</p>
</li>
	<li>Select the makefile:
		<p>Go to the &quot;src&quot; directory and rename 'Makefile.dos' (or 'Makefile.ibm' if you don't want
		   graphics and sound or if you didn't download the Allegro library) to 'Makefile'.</p>
</li>
	<li>Compile Angband:
		<p>Run &quot;make install&quot;.  Angband should now be compiled and installed into the Angband folder.</p>
</li>
	<li>Run Angband:
		<p>Go back to the Angband folder and run Angband.exe.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A possible problem is that Make exits with a 'Fatal: Command arguments too long' error message;
such problems are usually caused by using the make.exe of another compiler (like Borland C++ or cygwin).
DJGPP uses some clever tricks to get around the limitations of the MS-DOS &quot;126 characters are enough
for anybody&quot; commandline that require a specific make tool.  So make sure that DJGPP's make.exe is the
first (or only) make.exe in your path.  See also the DJGPP FAQ entries 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 for further
details.</p>

<h3>Windows 95/98/NT/2000 + MS Visual C++ 5.0/6.0</h3>
<p>Written by Robert Ruehlmann (rr9@angband.org)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Install the Angband source:
		<p>Get the source code and the untgz tool from: ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Tool/untgz32.exe.
		   Then extract the source with untgz32.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install other required files:
		<p>Get the &quot;extra archive&quot; from ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Windows/ext-win-300.zip.
		   Go to the angband directory and unzip the ext-win archive into it. Again, make sure the
		   directory structure is preserved (use the -d option in pkunzip).</p>
</li>
	<li>Open the project-file:
		<p>Go to the src folder and open the file &quot;Angband.dsw&quot;.  That opens Visual C++ already properly
		   configured for compiling Angband.</p>
</li>
	<li>Compile Angband:
		<p>Select &quot;Build Angband.exe&quot; in the Build menu.  Angband should now be compiled and the Angband.exe
		   will be placed into the Angband folder.</p>
</li>
	<li>Run Angband:
		<p>Go back to the Angband folder and run the Angband.exe.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows 95/98/NT/2000 + Borland C++ 5.5 commandline tools</h3>
<p>Written by Robert Ruehlmann (rr9@angband.org)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Getting the free commandline tools:
		<p>Download the Borland commandline tools from http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/
		   and follow the installation instructions.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install the Angband source:
		<p>Get the source code and the untgz tool from: ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Tool/untgz32.exe.
		   Then extract the source with untgz32.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install other required files:
		<p>Get the &quot;extra archive&quot; from ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Windows/ext-win-300.zip. Go to the
		   angband directory and unzip the ext-win archive into it. Again, make sure the directory structure is
		   preserved (use the -d option in pkunzip).</p>
</li>
	<li>Compile Angband:
		<p>Open a command prompt window and go to the src directory.  Run &quot;make -f makefile.bcc install&quot;.
		   Angband should now be compiled and installed into the Angband folder.</p>
</li>
	<li>Run Angband:
		<p>Go back to the Angband folder and run the Angband.exe.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A possible problems is that make exits with a &quot;Command line too long&quot; error message: Try to add the -l option
to the make command.  The make util should have the &quot;use long command lines&quot; option enabled by default, but some
people reported that this is not always the case.</p>

<h3>Windows + Cygwin</h3>
<p>Written by Andrew Sidwell (nevermiah@hotmail.com)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Getting the compiler:
		<p>If you don't already have it, get the Cygwin compiler from http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.
		   The cygwin tools are ports from Unices, and provide a unix-like working enviroment for
		    Windows.</p>
</li>
	<li>Extract the Angband source code
		<p>Start up the cygwin shell, download the source and get into the right directory.  Example: if
		   you downloaded the source to R:\Pineapples\Source\, then &quot;cd /cygdrive/R/Pineapples/Source&quot;
		   Extract the source code with &quot;tar -xvzf angband-3.0.0.tar.gz&quot;.</p>
</li>
	<li>Install other required files:
		<p>Get the &quot;extra archive&quot; from ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Windows/ext-win-300.zip. Go to the
		   angband directory and unzip the ext-win archive into it. Again, make sure the directory structure is
		   preserved (use the -d option in pkunzip).</p>
</li>
	<li>Compile Angband:
		<p>Go to the src directory.  Run &quot;make -f makefile.cyg install&quot;. Angband should now be compiled and
		   installed in the Angband folder.</p>
</li>
	<li>Run Angband:
		<p>Go back to the Angband folder and run the Angband.exe.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>GNU/Linux or Unix + GCC</h3>
<p>Written by Robert Ruehlmann (rr9@angband.org)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Install the Angband source:
		<p>Extract the source code with &quot;tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz&quot;.</p>
</li>
	<li>Compile Angband:
		<p>Run &quot;./configure&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, and &quot;make install&quot; in the Angband directory. &quot;./configure --help&quot; gives
		   a list of &quot;modules&quot; which you can use; ---enable-gtk is probably the most useful one of these;
		   it enables the GTK visual display.  --enable-borg is broken at the current time.  Note that if you
		   install Angband as root, then GTK will not work; if you installing it as a user, then set the PREFIX
		   enviroment variable to &quot;~&quot; or some other local, system-inspecific place.</p>
</li>
	<li>Run Angband:
		<p>Start Angband with &quot;angband&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
