Behaviour of new monster lighting
---------------------------------
ABSORB_LIGHT monsters will absorb nearby light, reducing the practical
radius of the light to 0.

EMANATE_LIGHT monsters emit light; radius should be 2 or 3, depending on
level.

CARRY_LIGHT monsters are theoretically "carrying" light sources, which
should be radius 1 or 2, depending on level; probably, the transition
shouldn't occur much later than dungeon level 15.

--Could this light source be dropped or somehow run out?

--GW-- well if a basic monster inventory could be created this could
done, however the balancing issues would be pretty major. Of course
if we are to make this variant truely different then this could be an
interesting way of doing it. Another way could be to add lines into
the info files for the monsters to specify some generic drop types
I suppose themed drops would be more accurate, in fact I think this
has been done in other variants, but I'm not too sure how successfully
though. The main problem with the second idea is that the light source
wouldn't 'exist' until the creature is killed and therefore would be
more difficult to make run out in a nice way.

If an ABSORB_LIGHT monster is in the vicinity of a [CARRY|EMANATE]_LIGHT
monster, the priority of effects is EMANATE_LIGHT, ABSORB_LIGHT and then
CARRY_LIGHT.  CARRY_LIGHT monsters may be scared by the absence of
light, and may try to get away.

--GW-- hmm, if a monster with [EMANATE|CARRY]_LIGHT has no other way of
seeing in the dark (ie infra_vision, esp, etc) then maybe they would
fear being in the dark, or maybe ,if they do have an alternate sense,
the may just merely be slightly more timid and not all out scared.

--ABSORB_LIGHT monster could also possibly be afraid of EMANATE_LIGHT
  monsters.

--GW-- see above
