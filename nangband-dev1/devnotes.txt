Behaviour of new monster lighting
---------------------------------
ABSORB_LIGHT monsters will absorb nearby light, reducing the practical
radius of the light to 0.

EMANATE_LIGHT monsters emit light; radius should be 2 or 3, depending on
level.

CARRY_LIGHT monsters are theoretically "carrying" light sources, which
should be radius 1 or 2, depending on level; probably, the transition
shouldn't occur much later than dungeon level 15.

--Could this light source be dropped or somehow run out?

If an ABSORB_LIGHT monster is in the vicinity of a [CARRY|EMANATE]_LIGHT
monster, the priority of effects is EMANATE_LIGHT, ABSORB_LIGHT and then
CARRY_LIGHT.  CARRY_LIGHT monsters may be scared by the absence of
light, and may try to get away.

--ABSORB_LIGHT monster could also possibly be afraid of EMANATE_LIGHT
  monsters.
