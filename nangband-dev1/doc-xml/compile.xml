<h1>Compiling Angband</h1>
<p>You probably won't need to compile Angband if you use Windows or DOS, as
these ports are normally available precompiled.  However, if you want to
compile your own personalized version (or if the port for your particular
platform doesn't exist), then read on.</p>

<h2>Compiling for UNIX/Linux/etc. (quick and dirty way)</h2>
<p>To compile on a UNIX system, you'll need sources.  These can be found at
ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Variant/Nangband - look for the most
recent version.  Extract the stuff from the archive (if it's a targz,
"tar -xvzf filename", or a zip "unzip filename").  Go into the directory
you just extracted (nangband-x.x.x, probably) and try "./configure"
("./configure --help" if you want to change any options).  Then "make",
and "make install", and you will have the executable "nangband" either in
/usr/local/bin, or wherever you specified it be put.</p>

<p>Of course, there's another makefile - "Makefile.std" in "src/".  If
you "cd src; make -f Makefile.std portname", where "portname" is one
of "only-gcu" (only console support), "only-x11" (only X11 support),
"x11-gcu" (both X11 and console support in the same executable),
and "gtk" (GTK/X11/console support). "make -f Makefile.std install"
will copy to exectuable one level up, so:
<pre>
cd src/; make -f Makefile.std gtk install; cd ../; ./nangband
</pre>
would compile and run nangband using the "standard" makefile.
