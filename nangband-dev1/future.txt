Nangband Future Directions
==========================

This file contains "todo"/"may do" list items that are too long to sensibly
fit on one or two lines.

Add something similar to the Blood of Life patch.  Make it restore the player
to full HP when it gets below 1.

Add parts of the Macro FAQ to the Nangband help system.

Rewrite enchant() to work on forumulas instead of a table.  Also change it
so it gets harder to enchant to-dam as you get nearer the maximum damage
the weapon can do.  So a 1d4 dagger is easy to get +1 dam, fairly easy to get
+2 dam, fairly hard to get +3 dam, and hard to get +4 dam.

There should be a macro in defines.h to check if an item is *id*'d.  Personally,
I think "levels" of ID should be removed and have it on a "use-and-find-out"
model.  This will require a whole load of work, though.

Some cheat options can be removed. cheat_know can be made into a one-off debug
command. cheat_live can be made a birth option. cheat_live shoud be a birth
option.  Debug mode characters should also be able to turn birth options on
and off.

All gameplay options possible should be removed; this makes the game more
balanced.
