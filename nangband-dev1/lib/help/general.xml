<title>Angband Online Help System: General Information</title>
<body>
<h1>General Information</h1>
<p>
Angband is basically a complex single player dungeon simulation.  A player
creates a character, choosing from a variety of sexes, races and classes,
and then "runs" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop
owners.  Then the player can descend into the Pits of Angband, where he will
explore the many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing fierce
creatures, collecting powerful objects and valuable treasure, and returning
to town occasionally to barter for new supplies.  Eventually, as the player
grows more experienced, he may attempt to win the game by defeating Morgoth,
the Lord of Darkness, who resides far below the surface.

Note that Angband is a very complex game, and it may be difficult to grasp everything at first, especially if you have never played a "roguelike" game
before.  You should probably browse through all of the "online help files", especially the <link file="demo.xml">"quick demonstration"</link>, before beginning any serious adventuring...
