<h2 align="centre">Licencing of Nangband</h2>

<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>Nangband is under the GPL licence; it is shown in gpl.txt. If anyone has
any objections to the licence Nangband is under, they should contact myself
(Andrew Sidwell) at nevermiah@hotmail.com.</p>

<p>Note that this licence applies to the source, &quot;library&quot; files and the Nangband
borg sources (and it's borg.txt config file).</p>

<p>Nangband's code may be used in non Nangband-derivitive projects; that code may
be considered under the Angband or GPL licences.</p>

<h3>Some History</h3>
<p>Nangband (like Angband and it's friends) used to be under the following licence:</p>

<pre>This software may be copied and distributed for educational, research,
and not for profit purposes provided that this copyright and statement
are included in all such copies.  Other copyrights may also apply.</pre>

<p>Many developers also dual-licenced their code under the GPL; Vanilla Angband's status
with regards to this is at
http://thangorodrim.angband.org/development/opensource.html</p>

<p>However, I (Andrew Sidwell) decided that Angband's code could be counted as
entirely GPL'able - as the person who ported Moria to C has allowed his code
to be distributed under the GPL, and many patches have had no licence
explicitly set out, so are (by default) under the maintainer's preferred
licence (which, in this case is dual Angband/GPL).  Also, I believe that
the traditional Angband Licence could not be legally used in a court of law,
as otherwise, I wouldn't have changed the licence for fear of being sued (even
though the GPL and Angband licences are the same in spirit).</p>

<p>I hope that nobody minds the licence change, and if they do, could they please
contact me privately about it to dicuss the neccessary changes I'd have to make
to put Nangband under the GPL.</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
