Instructions on using the borg
------------------------------

[currently invalid due to the fact the borg doesn't work]

First, make sure the borg is compiled in to your version of Nangband.

If it isn't, and you can compile, then modify your makefile to include the borg
[files borg1-9.c]. You will have to compile with ALLOW_BORG defined [usually by
adding -DALLOW_BORG to CFLAGS].

After you have a version with the borg, start the game up.  Make a character or
use an old character.  Press Control-Z, read the messages and make sure you
follow the instructions.  The borg will now run.

The borg may get stuck in certain situations.  He may have a Clock Overflow.
He may loop buying and selling the same stuff over and over.  Believe me when
I say that these have been addressed.  His loops are greatly reduced.

Continuous Play Mode: (option)
Upon the death of a borg, he will automatically reroll a random character,
with a random name and start fresh from clevel 1.  To enable the Continuous
Play Mode, turn the game option cheat_live on.  To do that enter the
options by pressing the equal sign (=) then Cheat Options (6).

If you want, you can tell the borg to select a certain race and or class for
the next one rolled up.  You can make these selections from the borg.txt file.

The Continual Play Mode is NOT turned on by default, you will need to
select it.
