Todo list for Nangband
======================

- Add race/class powers to the game using Lua.  Can be done like the
  spells.
- Remove haggling.
- (Suggested by Zach Levi) Add inscriptions that exclude items from the
  using list.
- Write a Qt port.
- Externalize more stuff; things that have been suggested are equipment
  slots, tvals and stores.
- Add player ghosts.
- Allow stacking of rods, wands, and staves with different charges.
- Add a random name generator for player names.
- Add support for automatically numbering characters ("Rocky IV").
- Open the file handles for score and savefiles at startup and then drop
  all permissions.
- Rewrite the scorefile format.
- Add the new helpfile system.
- Find a better way for saving options than appending to .prf files.
  Maybe use .opt files?
- Allow multiple pvals per object.
- Split long lines in the message recall.
- The ANSI-C standard reserves some prefixes for external names like "str".
  Make sure that Angband doesn't use them.
- Rewrite the debug-mode object flag display so that it doesn't require
  manual changes for every new flag.
- Use sizeof(buffer) instead of using the numeric size. The compiler is
  won't forget to update the number when the size of the buffer changes.
- Fix the "vinfo_type" hack in cave.c.
- Unify line of sight and projection paths.
- Make sure that signed integers aren't bit-shifted.
- Use enumerations instead of #defines when possible.
- Add optional support for the metric system.
- Add a main-net.c modules that sends/receives term-updates via TCP/IP.
  This allows slim clients on machines where Angband isn't available.
  The clients could be written in almost any programming language and
  have minimal hardware requirements.
- Adjust the Unix/Linux installation for full compliance with the
  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
- Make the filenames in src/ more meaningful.
- Add reference counting for the "quarks" (inscriptions).
- Add a compile-time option that prevents the player from saving pref-files,
  character dumps, and screenshots.
- "Panic saves" shouldn't overwrite normal savefiles. (do this like the
  RISC OS port).
- Replace the maximize mode option with a "half-maximized" mode.
- Properly integrate the transparency code into the game.
- Add a command to display the 'time of day'.
- Mimics should be true objects until the player steps next to them.
- Throwing potions should cause the potions effect on the target.
- Add race-specific starting equipment.
- Change the spell list and remove or downgrade the GoI spell.
- Extend the use of scripts for customization.
- Improve the script-debugger.
- Allow a restricted amount of functions to be used by the player
  for macros and add a better macro recorder.
- Improve the savefile handling of the monster recall.
- Seperate structure into those that need initializing once, at game load,
  or during character load/generation.
- Implement race/class powers, using lua.
- Players start with "full" equipment and little money.
- Work on brief item recall function.
- Store interface change.
- Documentation needs to be updated.
- Make IMPACT weapons have high critical chances.
- Move everything possible to variables from flags.
- Fix artifact spoilers.
