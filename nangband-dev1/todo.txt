Todo list for Nangband
======================

= Major gameplay
  + Race/class powers.  Can be done like spells in lua.
  + Add player ghosts.
  + Make players start with a full set of equipment and little money.

= Minor gameplay
  + Remove haggling.
  + Make IMPACT weapons have high critical chances.
  + Throwing potions should cause the potions effect on the target.
  + Add something similar to ToME's history editing.

= Bugs
  + Ego-items are pretty broken.

= User Interface
  + Add inscriptions that exclude items from the using list.
  + Allow stacking of rods, wands, and staves with different charges.
  + Add a random name generator for player names (code already exists).
  + Add support for automatically numbering characters ("Rocky IV").
  + Find a better way to save options than appending to pref files.
  + Split long lines in the message recall.
  + Brief item recall function is broken.
  + Add optional support for the metric system.
  + Add a command to display the 'time of day'.
  + Store interface needs changing.
  + "Panic saves" shouldn't overwrite "normal" savefiles.
  + Write a KDE/Qt port.
  + Allow a restricted amount of functions to be used by the player
    for macros and add a better macro recorder.
  + Add a main-net.c modules that sends/receives term-updates via TCP/IP.
    This allows slim clients on machines where Angband isn't available.
    The clients could be written in almost any programming language and
    have minimal hardware requirements.
  + Extend the use of scripts for customization.

= Data files
  + Externalize more stuff; things that have been suggested are equipment
    slots, tvals and stores.
  + Change the scorefile format.
  + Documentation needs lots of updating.
  + Artifact spoilers are broken; they need fixing.

= Code-wise
  + Fix the "vinfo_type" hack in cave.c.
  + Unify line of sight and projection paths.
  + Move everything possible to variables from flags.
  + Add race-specific starting equipment.
  + Rename some source files to give more meaningful names.
  + Add reference counting for the "quarks" (inscriptions).
  + Seperate structure into those that need initializing once, at game load,
    or during character load/generation.  This will let the borg's
    "respawning" stuff much less hacky.
  + Open the file handles for score and savefiles at startup and then drop
    all permissions.
  + The ANSI-C standard reserves some prefixes for external names like "str".
    Make sure that Nangband doesn't use them.
  + Rewrite the debug-mode object flag display so that it doesn't require
    manual changes for every new flag.
  + Make sure that signed integers aren't bit-shifted.
  + Use enumerations instead of #defines when possible.
  + Adjust the Unix/Linux installation for full compliance with the
    Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
  + Add a compile-time option that prevents the player from saving pref-files,
    character dumps, and screenshots.
