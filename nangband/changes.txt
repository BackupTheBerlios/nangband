- Don't allow the user to enter a higher number of items to buy in a store than
  they can actually buy.  --parody

  game now aborts when buying if the player doesn't have enough money to buy
  an item and they try to.  --takk
- If the player can't afford an item, its price is greyed out in the price
  column.  --takk
- Fix the Borland makefile so the lua object files are put in the right 
  place.  --takk
- Made the birthscreens a lot slicker - they now use text_out_to_screen 
  instead of hardwrapping.  Various things have also been rearranged to 
  the entire process feels a lot cleaner.  --takk
