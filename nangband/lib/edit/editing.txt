Group calculations
==================

When a group of monsters is going to be placed, various things happen regarding
the size of the group.  First, the total starts off as a random number from 1
to 13.  Then, if the monster's level is higher than the player's current depth,
a random number from 1 to (monster level - player depth) is taken from the
total.  However, if the player's depth is more than the monster's level, then
the total is incremented by either 12 or a random number from 1 to the difference
between the two levels, whichever is smaller.

Then the "minimum size" and "maximum size" checks are performed. For the minumum
size check, we get a random number from 1 to the max group size (specified by the
monster, or 32 by default).  If the number is lower than the minumum group size
(specified by the monster, or 4 by default), then the total number of monsters
is reset to that number.  Otherwise, if the current total is lower than the group
minimum, then it is reset to the minimum.  The maximum size check just checks that
the total doesn't exceed the maximum group size.

Note that in other variants, the minimum size check normally just ensures that the
total has not dropped under 1.
