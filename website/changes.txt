Nangband Website changelog
==========================

I'm bored of adding "(takkaria)" to the end of every changelog entry.  
It's not like anyone else even changes the code here.  So, from now on, 
I'm not going to bother.

02-08-02
-------- (takkaria)
- Rewrote loads.  Made it much more flexible. Removed the hardcoded
  references to Nangband.  Almost ready to commit as MWMS at sourceforge.

19-07-02
-------- (takkaria)
- Added a nice directory lister in place of the default page in content/.
- "Externalized" the style headers and footers.
- Added styles as an array to files.php.
- Changed the behaviour of the "showimage" so that images/"page".desc is
  shown; this should make the "changing-style-looses-image" bug I found.
- Added quick hack to perform the above.
- Added some content to content/changes; the changelist is there, now.

18-07-02
--------
- Changed the clean style completely.  It looks good with all browsers
  (Dillo included!) and better with Gecko.  It is, of course,
  text-browser compliant.  (takkaria)
- Loadsa fiddling.  Removed some CSS warnings.  Did other neat stuff, I'm
  sure.  (takkaria)
- Added the "plain" style.  Looks better in text-based browsers than the 
  others. (takkaria)
- Added image showing facility to the main page.  I'm thinking I might 
  start another rewrite soon! (takkaria)

07-07-02
--------
- Made the site much more flexible and added references to a few pages 
which don't exist.  (takkaria)

05-07-02
--------
- Added a timing counter to the Nangband changes page for fun.  It needs 
  gmtime.inc which is now in the content/ directory. (takkaria)
- Removed the "content lister" - I've chosen a different approach now. 
  (takkaria)
- Really got the site valid, and added links to the validators at the 
  bottom of the page. (takkaria)
- Reorganized stuff; now there are extras in "extras/"; this directory is 
  scanned and all files are included from there.  (takkaria)

01-07-02
--------
- Cleaned up some code in layout.php - the links code is now much nicer; 
  it'll get cleaned up even more when I have the time. (takkaria)
- Forgot to add the main page to CVS! (takkaria)
- Got the entire site valid to HTML 4.01 standards; this includes *both* 
  stylesheets and all content.  I have too much free time! (takkaria)
- Started working on a "content lister".  Unfinished and broken. 
  (takkaria)

30-06-02
--------
- Started keeping this changelog. (takkaria)
- Rewrote site to only have one PHP page which displays the appropriate
  content for each page.  Much cleaner than before.  Not tested!
  (takkaria)
- Tested.  Forgot a minor detail, but that's been fixed now :) 
  (takkaria)
- Changed a minor detail - I didn't mention that the daily compiles were
  Windows ports. (takkaria)
- Added a script to upload the latest CVS to the webserver. (takkaria)
- Added the basics of "themeability" at the user's end for the site.
  Silly, but never mind. (takkaria)
- Removed a comment in the changelog page about the RISC OS port being
  completely broken. (takkaria)
- Made cookies expire a few years after setting. (takkaria)
- Move the stylesheets into styles/. (takkaria)
