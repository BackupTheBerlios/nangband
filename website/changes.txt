Nangband Website changelog
==========================

01-07-02
--------
- Cleaned up some code in layout.php - the links code is now much
  nicer; it'll get cleaned up even more when I have the time.
  (takkaria)
- Forgot to add the main page to CVS! (takkaria)
- Got the entire site valid to HTML 4.01 standards; this includes
  *both* stylesheets and all content.  I have too much free time!
