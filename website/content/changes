<p>Nangband has made some quite major changes in the time it has been in development. A brief outline of some of them are listed here:
<ul>
<li>Bigscreen support for the stores. This means that stores will now use the maximum available space for display. There is still one bug related to this.</li>
<li>Rewrite of the resist system. It is now more like EyAngband's system.</li>
</ul>
</p>
