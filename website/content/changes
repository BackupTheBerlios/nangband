<p>Nangband has made some quite major changes in the time it has been in development. A brief outline of some of them are listed here:
<pre>
- Changed referances to 'lite', to 'light'. (parody)
- Added a basic monster kill count. (parody)
- Moved the stat bonuses from the pval to their own variable. (takkaria)
- New makefile.std --> cygwin is incroporated into it now.
- Instead of being capped at 1600, many monster breaths are now capped
  at their dungeon level * 10. Suggested by JLE and Nathan Mahon.
  (takkaria)
- Object recall code. (takkaria)
- Changed some function names. (takkaria)
- Added the view_player_colour option from Zangband CVS; this changes the 
  colour of your '@' depending on how much HP you have left. (takkaria)
- Removed the unused 'alert_failure' option. (takkaria)
- Added tins of caviar as a new deep food source (grahame).
- Improved the layout of the birthscreen. Implemented the first
  (excessive) use of 'Window Popups'.
- The RISC OS port is now completely broken. The lua scripts take a part
  in this. I'm trying to fix it. (takkaria)
- Remember to add Livingstones, Phase Reavers and the joke monster
  'The Iron Lady'. (takkaria)
- Added in Antiband's new roller code, along with changes to init1.c
  so defaults can be non-hardcoded. (takkaria)
- Added Antiband's new vaults. (takkaria)
- Rewrote small chunks of the store code for better displaying. (takkaria)
- Added bigscreen support for the stores. (takkaria)
- Made the '2' and '8' keys move up and down one item when in the stores. (takkaria)
- EyAngband style resists. (takkaria)
- Made areas of detection circlular. Taken the rough way of doing it from ToME.
  (takkaria)
- Completely ruined the character info screen. (takkaria)
- Removed the 'smart_cheat' option. (takkaria)
- Removed the light element from the game. (takkaria)
- Made the title screen bigscreen-compliant. (takkaria)

- Added belts of starvation as a new ego type. (grahame)
- Added Nexus, Chaos and Nether brands (from Antiband).
- Tweaked the artifacts.
- Added the Ring of Elemental Mastery (from Antiband).

  Very few exist at the moment. (takkaria)
- Added the HUNGER flag which vastly increases the amount of food
  required by the player (grahame)
- Added a belt slot and some belts to wear in those. There are also
  ego-item belts. (grahame)
