<p>Here is documentation on Nangband's development; it is similar in motives to mozilla.org's <a 
href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap.html" title="Mozilla.org Roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p>

<p><a href="?showimage=devplan.gif">The development plan</a> (GIF image) shows the development cycle of 
Nangband.  It is a 6-4-3 cycle; Destabilizing development is carried out in the first 6 weeks, then 
stabilizing development is done for the next 4, and in the last 3, the tree is frozen - only bugfixes 
are made.  Most development will go on in the first six weeks; major changes will be made then.  
Stability does not matter at that point, but the sources must always compile.  By the seventh week, 
stabilizing development has started.  Development in general slows down at this point; effort is 
co-ordinated towards stabilization of the sources and playability.  During the "frozen" weeks, the 
only development done is bugfixing.  The release candidates are made in the period, followed by the 
major release.</p.
