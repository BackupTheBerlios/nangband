<p><b>There are no releases yet, as Nangband is in pre-alpha form.</b></p>

<p>Scott Holder has kindly offered to compile nightly (5am Eastern time)
CVS versions of Nangband.  Download the zipfile <a
href="http://ncc1701.home.mindspring.com/nang/">here</a>.  Note that 
this is <em>not</em> an official release; it might be very hard (or
even impossible) to play certain parts of the game - this is the
risk of playing CVS versions.</p>

<p>However, there are some plans as to what will be relased (and when).
The first  'proper' release will be 1.0.0, but there will be varying
public betas before this.  The first public beta will be labelled as
0.5.4, because it's a nice number.  It will be released sometime
(originally, it was going to be released in May 2002, but that seems
somewhat impossible now).  Future betas are not planned yet.</p>
