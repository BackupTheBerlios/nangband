<p>There are some great pages on Angband out there.  Here are some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thangorodrim.angband.org">Thangorodrim - The Angband Page</a>: the best variant 
database around.  Download Angband, and all it's variants there!</li>
<li><a href="http://angband.oook.cz/" title="angband.oook.cz">Angband.oook.cz</a>: Home of the 
Vanilla CVS, spoilers for many variants, screenshot gallery, ability to browse sources, help files 
and edit files; mirror of some Angband goodies, and home of the Angband ladder, where you upload 
your character dumps and get them compared to all the others that have been uploaded.  Cool 
site.</li>
<li><a href="http://itctel.com/~apwhite/andrew.html" title="The Borg">APW's Borg site</a>: The most 
frequently updated Borg out there.  Download the latest version here, as well as being able to 
download DrAngband, an <i>interesting</i> variant.</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=rec.games.roguelike.angband" 
title="rec.games.roguelike.angband at google.com">rec.games.roguelike.angband at google.com</a>: 
(possibly) the oldest place where Angband players can collect together to share character dumps, 
stories, opinions and flame wars.  Google.com maintain the biggest archive of usenet messages, and 
you can also post to r.g.r.a from the site.  Just make sure you ignore Mark Constantino.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.afn.org/~afn45964/angband/index.html" title="The Typical Angband Page">The 
Typical Angband Page:</a> Just another Angband-related site.  I got the basic design for the 
"sidebar" theme on this site from there; it also contains some cool stuff, though it hasn't been 
touched for a while.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kellnet.com/wooledge/angband.html" title="Greg's Angband Page">Greg's 
Angband Page</a>: Home of GW-Angband and the randart patch.  GW-Angband is a variant everyone 
should play at least twice; it has nice gameplay changes.</li>
</ul>
