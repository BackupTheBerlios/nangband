<p>Nangband is a new Angband variant which is currently in its first "development cycle"; ie. it has not been released 
yet.  It will feature lots of things by its first release, but as few of them have been written yet, they can't be 
advertised as such.</p>

<!-- <p>Nangband is an Angband variant still in alpha stage, and only available via CVS.  It features a full
rewrite of the savefile code, a new resists system similar to EyAngband, seperate stat bonuses, object recall
and three new races from Antiband.</p> -->

no names</a>) rejected us.</p>
